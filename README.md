MathWiz - Calculator Java Application using RMI(Remote Method Invocation) Technology


Instructions :

Run start.bat and wait about 10 seconds for the whole process to finish. After it finished you'll have four different cmd windows : one finished with a rmiregistry command, don't touch that one, one saying "server running", that's the server, same rule, leave it and two client windows (added two to prove that the calculators are independent from each other, they do not share anything). Follow the commands from the client next.

Plans for the future :

Implement a GUI
